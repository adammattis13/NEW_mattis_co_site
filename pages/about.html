                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mattis & Co was founded on a simple premise: the best investors are those who've built, 
                            operated, and scaled businesses themselves. We're not career financiers. We're operators 
                            who happen to invest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After decades of building and running companies across technology, infrastructure, and services, 
                            we saw an opportunity to do private equity differently. To focus on businesses that matter. 
                            To work with founders and management teams as partners, not overlords.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, we split our time between investing in overlooked opportunities that rebuild communities 
                            and advising leaders through the complex transformations that define modern business. 
                            Two practices. One mission: Building value that lasts.

                            "We invest in places others ignore and advise companies through changes others avoid. 
                            The best opportunities aren't found in boardrooms—they're discovered in communities, 
                            built in the field, and proven in the market."
